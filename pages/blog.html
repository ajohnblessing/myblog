            <p> <b> Falling in love </b> <br>
               Falling in love is the development of strong feelings of attachment and love, <br>
               usually towards another person. The termis metaphorical, emphasing <br>
               that the process, like the physical act of falling, is sudden, uncontrollable<br>
               and leaves the lover in a vulnerable state, similar to "fall ill".<br>
               Falling in love is easily one of the best feelings ever. That is why there <br>
               are so many articles, songd, movies and reality shows about love amd relationship <br>
               Its an essential part of our lives which sometimes controls our mood; either we are <br>
               happy, contented or heartbroken. These feelings tend to affect us more than we even <br>
               realise. Being in a healthy relationship helps to boost our self confidence which in <br>
               turn boost other areas of our life. The feeling of knowing someone has your back and <br>
               would always stand by you no matter what is one of the major reasons people venture <br>
               into relationships because we feel safe and secured with our partners. <br>

            <p> <b> Intimacy </b> <br>
               Intimacy in a relationship is a feeling of <br>
               being close, and emotionally connected and <br>
               suppoted. It means being able to share a whole <br>
               range of thoughts, feelings and experiences that <br>
               we have as human beings. It involves being open <br>
               and talking through your thoughts and emotions, <br>
               letting your guards down (being vulnerable)and <br>
               showing someone else how you feel and what hopes <br>
               and dreams you have. Intimacy is build overtime, <br>
               and requireseffort and patience from both partners <br>
               to create and maintain. Discovering intimacy with <br>
               someone you love can be one most rewarding aspect of a <br>
               relatonship. Apart from sexual and emotional intimacy, <br>
               you can also be intimate recreationally, intellectually, <br>
               financially, creatively and at times of crisis. Intimacy <br>
               is achieved when we become close to someone else and are <br>
               reassured and accepted for who we are. <br>
               For many couples, 'making love' requires a sense of imtimacy <br>
               and emotional closeness. An intimate sexual relationship involves <br>
               trust and being vulnerable with one another. Closeness during sex <br>
               is also linke to other forms of intimacy including emotional and <br>
               spiritual intimacy. Intercourse is only a part of sexual intimacy <br>
               which involves foreplay and other forms of physical intimacy. <br>
               Explore different ways to share love and affectuin without sex <br>
               and remember that sex includes, many different forms of physical <br>
               contact. Often, the more a couple is intimate with each other in <br>
               ways other than sex, the more fulfilling their sex life becomes. <br>

            <p> <b> 5 Signs your partner is loosing interest in you </b> </p>
            <ul class="five-reasons">
               <li>
                  <b> Your partner feels more like a roommate </b>
                  <p>A partner may be loosing interest vif thry start to act more <br>
                     like a roommate than a lover. If you both live together, this might <br>
                     in what could be called a "figid" vibe. For example, they no longer want <br>
                     cuddle, or they stop eating breakfast with you or dont interrac5t with you <br>
                     like they normally do. If you don't live together, you coukd pick on a drop <br>
                     in intimacy, like lack of desire to plan ahead for date nights or fewer hugs. <br>
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <b> You haven't had sex in a while </b>
                  <p> In a similar vein, if you are usec to falling into bed pratically every night, <br>
                     it might seem like a red flag if your partner is suddenly less interested in sex. <br>
                     It is very important to keep it in mind that many spouses have sex less often as their <br>
                     relationshipgoes on and probably once the honeymoon phase comes to an end. <br>
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <b> Your conversations feels forced </b>
                  <p> There are number of reasons why a conversation might feel strained. especially <br>
                     if you recently argued, went through a tough time together or expressed deep feeling <br>
                     Your partner may be acting weird because they mifht have recently shared something <br>
                     that made them feel vulnerable with you and they aren't sure how to act around you <br>
                     at the moment. If that's the case, it's only natural for things to feel dry afterwards <br>
                     But if your text exchange and calls always feel dry afterwards, that would definitely be <br>
                     "Questionable".
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <b> They Don't Call or Text As Much </b>
                  <p> While there vare lots of reasons why a partner might drop their texting game for a short <br>
                     period of time such as a busy schedule, it is often a sign that they are loosing interest <br>
                     and therefore aren't willing to make talking to you a priority. <br>
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <b> They won't define the relationship </b>
                  <p> Not everyone often feel nthe need to label a relationship, a lack of willingness or commitment
                     <br>
                     to do so can certainly indicates that a person has lost inerest. So if you are a few months into
                     <br>
                     the relationship and still don't know who you "are" to each other, consider it a red flag. <br>

                  <b> Working to rebuild intimacy </b>
                  <p> By asking and queries like "what were the things we did in the beginning of our relationship<br>
                     that made us feel loved and appreciated?" Prioritise those fun and sweet things and see if it

               <li>
                  <b> Talk about your sex life </b>
                  <p> It is often tough to talk about sex, try to find some time to discuss with your partner <br>
                     about the changes you noticed and the amount of sex you'd like to have, and then see if <br>
                     there is a way to make both of you happy. <br>

               <li>
                  <b> Focus on your own life and success </b>
                  <p> Guys like girls who have focus whether its in their studies, careers, sport or any other
                     actitvity. <br>
                     Show him that you are a woman with dreams, ambition and passion. Focus on your own life and
                     vigorously <br>
                     pursue whatever you are doing at the moment. Men are naturally attracted to successful women: if
                     you <br>
                     manage to become one, there is little more you will hsve to do to make him want you morer and
                     more. <br>
                  </p>
               </li>
               <li>
                  <b> Be honest </b>
                  <p> Honesty is one simple word, but probably the most important aspect of a relationship, and
                     certainly an <br>
                     essential part of regaining love that may have lapsed. I'm sure you were honest at some points
                     in your <br>
                     bonding, when nothing seemed like a taboo, you could tell your partner everything there was to
                     know about <br>
                     yourself, try to work on your honesty and see your partner back in your arms.

               </li>
               <li>
                  <b> Trust one another </b>
                  <p> Following from the last step and working hand in hand with it, trust is the key to a lasting
                     bond of love. If you <br>
                     trust your partner, then love is not apparent if we allow untrusting thoughts consume us.
                     Regaining love without <br>
                     first regaining trust will be an uphill struggle and so start to work through you insecure
                     feelings as soon as possible. <br>
                     Ask yourself why you have lost the faith you once had in your partner, and try to regain that
                     and make things right again. <br>
